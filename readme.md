## Design philosophy
HttpUtils is meant to be a small library that extends and fills in some of the gaps that exist in `HttpClient`.

## Versioning
HttpUtils uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). In a nutshell:

> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
>
> 1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
> 2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
> 3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

## Examples
See [the wiki](https://github.com/rianjs/HttpUtils/wiki).

## Installation
HttpUtils is available as a nuget package [targeting .NET Standard 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard), which means it's compatible with a fairly wide range of .NET runtimes:

* .NET Core 1.0+
* .NET Framework 4.6.1+
* Mono 5.4+
* UWP 10.0.16299+
* Unity 2018.1+
* Etc.
